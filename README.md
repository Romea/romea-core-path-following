# romea_core_path_following

This project is C++ library that provides an implementation of a trajectory-following algorithm that can control a robot's deviation from its path as well as its speed. This is achieved by using the commands and sliding algorithms defined in the **romea_core_control** library.

This algorithm enables the robot to follow complex trajectories based on the **romea_core_path** library, potentially allowing for maneuvers such as half-turns or U-turns. It takes as input the results from a path matching algorithm provided in the **romea_core_path_matching** library.
